Prerequisites
-------------

In order to compile and use zfs-fuse, you need the following:

 * Linux kernel 2.6.x (2.6.15 or later recommended).

 * FUSE 2.5.x or greater (Gentoo users: FUSE-2.6.0rc1 and some 
earlier pre-release versions have a bug that prevents zfs-fuse
from compiling correctly, simply upgrade to FUSE-2.6.0 or later).

   You will need the fuse, fuse-utils and/or libfuse packages
(and associated -dev packages), depending on the distribution.

 * glibc version 2.3.3 or newer with NPTL enabled.
   You can check these requirements with following commands:

   getconf GNU_LIBC_VERSION
   getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION

   The output should be "glibc 2.3.3" and "NTPL 2.3.3" (or newer,
   of course).

 * SCons (packaged in most distributions)
   Only needed for compilation.
   Website: http://www.scons.org

Currently, it only works on the x86, amd64 and sparc64 architectures.

In order to use pools created on Solaris, you will probably need kernel
support for GPT/EFI partitions. EVMS is highly recommended in this case,
see http://evms.sourceforge.net

Compiling
---------

If you don't have SCons yet, do the usual 'sudo apt-get install scons',
'emerge scons' or 'yum install scons'.

To compile follow these steps:

  1) cd src
  2) scons

That's it!

If the compilation fails, please report a bug. See the BUGS file for
instructions.

Installing
----------

To install, run 'scons install' with appropriate privileges. It will
install the binaries in /usr/local/sbin by default.

Run 'scons install install_dir=/path/to/dir' if you want to install it in
another directory.
