Using
-----

This is an alpha release, so it might corrupt your files.
You should backup all your data first.

1) Start the run.sh script in src/zfs-fuse.

This will start the main zfs-fuse daemon process that must be running
at all times.
You should be running it with root permissions.

Currently it will use up to 100 MB of RAM (not configurable yet).

2) Use the zpool and zfs commands to manage pools and filesystems.

You can learn about these commands at the OpenSolaris ZFS community
site: http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/

If you find a bug, please report it. See the BUGS file for instructions.
