# zfs_pool_alert : this command is executed everytime a pool passes from the
# state HEALTHY to DEGRADED, or the other way around.
# It receives only the pool name as argument.
# Here this script tries to :
#  - if the new state is degraded
#    - if there are some spares available, try to use 1
#    - otherwise send a mail to tell a vdev is failing for this pool
#  - if the new state is healthy
#    - if there are still some spares in use, execute zpool clear, spares are
#    usually removed quite some time after that without sending any command.
